As a result, there is no apparent change in $U_3$ for the temperature range we consider. For $r=1$ and $r=2$ we get an increase in the same temperature domain, as their energy differences are comparable in size.

For $r=2$ the levels $s=2$ and $s=3$ starts to affect $U_2$ for similar temperature values, and their combined statistical weight is $g=10$, and we get a steeper increase in $U_2$ that also lasts longer.  \n",

For the upper panel all Calcium is neutral and in its ground state to begin with, but this fraction rapidly drops when reaching temperatures where singly ionized Calcium becomes dominant. For higher temperatures, excitation also plays an important role, as is evident for singly ionized Calcium, where a notable fraction of the population comes from $s=2$ and $s=3$. As temperature increases the different ionization stages overlap, and single ionization levels cease to dominate the entire population by themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this overlap between different ionisation stages and the excited states of each stage, the dominance of individual ionisation stages (and its excited states) falls off gradually. As a result, at a given temperature there are mostly 1-2 ionisations stages that are dominant. The ground state is always the most dominant state. . However, the trend is that once the temperature becomes significantly high the contribution of the different ionisation states becomes effectively zero, as predicted by the large temperature limit of the Saha equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar behaviour is also seen in the lower panel, where the electron pressure is increased by a factor $10^4$. In general we see that the different stages persist for much higher temperatures compared to the previous plot. For $s=1$ the individual curves are spread out over larger temperatures ranges, but are relatively similar in shape otherwise. Much higher temperatures are needed in order for ionization to occur in this case. When we increase the electron pressure we essentially increase the number density of surrounding electrons. A high density of electrons yields an increased Coulomb force on electrons in the atom and a higher energy is required to overcome the Coulomb potential and thus ionize the atoms. This can be seen from the populations of singly and doubly ionized Calcium, where both stages have excited states that are notably more abundant than before. For doubly ionized Calcium, the energy required to excite electrons is so high that for $P_e=100\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ the stage was largely ionized before any excitation took place. With increased electron pressure, the stage now consist of a relatively large fraction of excited states."

The ionisation energy is not much higher than the neutral excitation energies, so ionisation begins when the temperature is increased further. However, there are numerous neutral energy levels contributing near $T\\sim 5000\\,\\mathrm{K}$, but there is a large energy gap between the ground state and first excited state of singly ionised Sodium. This causes the slow decline of the neutral Sodium populations, and it's not until the temperature surpasses $T\\sim20\\,000\\,\\mathrm{K}$ that Sodium is mostly singly ionised. When excitation of singly ionised Sodium atoms become relevant, second ionisation becomes important, and as temperature rises even further, there is eventually a slow decaying population of singly ionised Sodium atoms, until the final ionisation stage takes over completely. If we compare the above plot to the plot for Calsium, we notice that the population of excited sodium is far less than the population of the ground state. An interpretation of this is that the ground state is far more dominant for sodium than it is for calsium. "

Plot in a log scale the relative population changes for the lower levels of $\\text{Ca}^+$ K and H $\\alpha$ vs. temperature, using  $\\Delta T=$ 1 K. Around $T=$ 5600 K the $\\text{Ca}^+$ K curve dips down to very  small values; the H $\\alpha$ curve does that around $T=$ 9500  K. Thus, at $T \\approx$ 5600 K the temperature sensitivity of $\\text{Ca}^+$ K is much smaller than the temperature sensitivity of H $\\alpha$. Compare these plots with plots of the populations of the lower levels for the two lines (normalise them to the maximum value of each for easier comparison). You should find that the population plots have a peak and two flanks. Explain each flank of the population plots and the dips in the temperature sensitivity plots.\n",
