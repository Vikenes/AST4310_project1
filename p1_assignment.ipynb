    "* The relative population change $(\\Delta n / \\Delta T) / n$ is useful to to diagnose the temperature sensitivity of the populations of a given atomic stage. Plot in a log scale the relative population changes for the lower levels of $\\text{Ca}^+$ K and H $\\alpha$ vs. temperature, using  $\\Delta T=$ 1 K. Around $T=$ 5600 K the $\\text{Ca}^+$ K curve dips down to very  small values; the H $\\alpha$ curve does that around $T=$ 9500  K. Thus, at $T \\approx$ 5600 K the temperature sensitivity of $\\text{Ca}^+$ K is much smaller than the temperature sensitivity of H $\\alpha$. Compare these plots with plots of the populations of the lower levels for the two lines (normalise them to the maximum value of each for easier comparison). You should find that the population plots have a peak and two flanks. Explain each flank of the population plots and the dips in the temperature sensitivity plots.\n",
