    "Initially, the partition function is dominated by the value of $g_{r,s}$ at the lowest level in each state, since $\\chi=0$ at these levels. For $s=1,2,3,4$ we have $g_{r,s}=1,2,1,4$, respectively, yielding the starting point of each curve. The remaining terms are strongly suppressed by the exponential term for low temperature values. The partition functions eventually start increasing with temperature, but at different points. The different starting points are mainly governed by the values of $g_{r,s}$ and $\\chi_{r,s}$ at the different stages. For low values of $\\chi$ the exponent will increase more rapidly. So for low energy differences between the ground state and the excited states in the different stages we will se an increment in $U_r$ at lower temperatures. This explains why the stage $s=3$ has a partition function that is more or less constant in the given temperature range. The energy difference from the ground state to the first excited state for this particular stage is more than ten times greater compared to the other stages. For $r=4$, the difference is approximately five times lower than that of $r=1$ and $r=2$, yielding a noticeable change in $U_r$ around $T=10^3\\,\\mathrm{K}$. For $r=1$ and $r=2$ $U_r$ starts increasing at around $T=4\\cdot 10^3\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With $\\chi$ governing the temperature ranges where we expect $U_r$ to start rising, the value of $g_{r,s}$ at these energies determines how much increment we may get. For $r=1$ there are numerous low values of $\\chi$, and with large values of $g$ in this stage, we see that $U_r$ increases steadily once a certain temperature has been reached. As temperature increases, more and more levels become dominant, where the factors of $g$ range from $g=1$ to $g=21$. This explains why the low temperature increment of $U_{r=4}$ eventually stabilizes. From the first excited state to the next one, $\\chi$ increases by a factor of around $50$. Thus, the first excited state is the only main contributor for the temperatures we consider, and having a factor of $g=2$ at this state we get a slow increment that eventually stabilizes. For $r=2$ all the excited states have a relatively low value, but having only four of them, at relatively low value, compared to $r=1$, the increment is less rapid, and eventually stabilizes. \n",

For the upper panel all Calcium is neutral and in its ground state to begin with, but this fraction rapidly drops at a certain temperature and singly ionized Calcium becomes dominant. As temperature increases, excitation also plays an important role, as is evident for singly ionized Calcium, where a noteable fraction of the population comes from $s=1$ and $s=2$. As temperature increases the different ionization stages overlap, and single ionization levels seize to dominate the entire population. Here, the excited states at different stages begin to play a significant role. The peaks of the ionization stages drops gradually as temperature increases, until we start reaching the final stage in our model atom, $r=6$. \n",
    "/// Fix above, add stuff if needed.     \n",

    "Similar behaviour is also seen in the lower panel, where the electron pressure is increased by a factor $10^4$. Although the $s=1$ curves are relatively similar in shape, much higher temperatures are needed in order for ionization to occur. When we increase the electron pressure we essentially increase the number density of surrounding electrons, leaving less space for a potentially free electron. A high density of electrons yields an increased Coulomb force on electrons in the atom and a higher energy is required for ionization to take place. This can also be seen from the populations of singly and doubly ionized Calcium, where singly ionized Calcium is noteably more abundant in the excited states, since the high temperatures have excited many of the electrons before a second ionization takes place. For doubly ionized Calcium, the energy required to excite electrons is so high that for $P_e=100\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ most of the electrons became ionized before they got excited. With increased electron pressure, this is no longer the case, and more electrons now become excited before the third ionization level becomes dominant once again.  \n",
